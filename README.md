Machine learning based Smart learning platform for Nursery school children.

Our research aims to develop a comprehensive machine learning-based smart learning platform designed specifically for 
nursery school children, delivered through a web application. Utilize advanced machine learning techniques to refine 
voice recognition patterns, tailored to the linguistic nuances of Sri Lankan nursery school children, thereby improving their 
pronunciation, fluency, and overall speaking abilities. Develop interactive drawing quizzes that leverage machine learning to 
assess and enhance children's drawing skills, encouraging creativity and fine motor development. Create an AI-driven 
coloring module that provides real-time feedback and mini-lessons on color theory, helping children develop better coloring 
techniques and artistic expression. Implement a personalized learning system that adapts to each child's unique learning 
pace and style, while also identifying and mitigating potential learning risks early on to ensure a smooth educational journey. 
By integrating these components into a user-friendly web application, our platform aims to provide a holistic, engaging, 
and effective learning experience for nursery school children, laying a strong foundation for their future educational 
endeavors
